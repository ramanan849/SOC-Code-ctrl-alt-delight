This is a story that happened over 500 years back along the banks of the river Tungabathra, a tributary of the river Krishna. Two brothers Hakka and Bukka are riding on their horses, planning, training to become the most skilled warriors in the Deccan region. Their guru, the Madhava saint Vyasathirtharu guided them, instilling in them immeasurable knowledge, wit and wisdom, all that is necessary to become wise rulers. The Vijayanagara empire founded by them became a citadel of hope amidst the dark times, a centre of arts, literature, science and more. Krishna, the son of Yashoda and the brother of Balarama, the destroyer if Kamsa. Hare Krishna! How can I thank you Lord Krishna?
